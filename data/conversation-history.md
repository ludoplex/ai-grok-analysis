## Title-Level Pattern Notes

### Void/Dissolution Adjacent (Potential):
- "Transporting Cremated Remains on Flights" — death/dissolution
- "Tesla Impersonation Scam Exposed" — deception/void of truth
- "CDN MITM Attack Investigation Urgency" — digital void/interception

### Predominantly Technical:
~90% of conversations are technical (programming, gaming, hardware, business). Low baseline expectation for void/dissolution language.

### Creative/Thematic:
- Image editing conversations (Crystal Gems, Kavinsky, Kanye, Harley Quinn)
- Game design (card games, fighting games, chess)
- Spamton/Deltarune content appears on Arena, NOT on Grok

### NOTE: Full conversation text extraction requires navigating to each chat individually. Current data is sidebar titles only.
