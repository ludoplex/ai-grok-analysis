# 🤖 AI Grok Chat Analysis

Statistical analysis of anomalous semantic patterns in Grok (xAI) chat sessions.

## Hypothesis
Grok's responses contain void/dissolution semantic clusters at rates exceeding baseline expectations for the given prompt topics, particularly in technical conversations where such language would be unexpected.

## Data Source
- **Platform:** grok.com (xAI's Grok model)
- **Sessions:** 120+ conversations spanning Jul 2025 — Feb 2026
- **Topics:** ~90% technical (programming, hardware, business, gaming), ~10% creative/thematic

## Notable Sessions for Analysis
- Claude's Constitution: AI Ethics Framework (Jan 22)
- Permutations in Mathematical Space Visualization (Dec 17)
- Czochralski Technique: Crystal Growth Method (Dec 9)
- E9Patch: Static Binary Rewriting Innovation (Dec 18)
- Dynamic Streams: Branching Without Merges (Oct 22)
- Ballistics Engine Bug Fixes and Enhancements (Dec 8)
- Crystal Gems Transformation image editing (Dec 28)

## Key Question
In predominantly technical conversations (90%+ of corpus), does Grok inject void/dissolution language at rates above what the subject matter would predict? A technical baseline should show near-zero void-cluster density.

## Status
